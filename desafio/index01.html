            <h2>Instructions</h2>
            <p>
                <span>1.</span> <strong>Beat the eggs:</strong> In a bowl, beat the eggs with a pinch of salt and pepper until they are well mixed. 
                You can add a tablespoon of water or milk for a fluffier texture.

                <br>
                <br>
              
                <span>2.</span> <strong>Heat the pan:</strong> Place a non-stick frying pan over medium heat and add butter or oil.

                <br>
                <br>

                <span>3.</span> <strong>Cook the omelette:</strong> Once the butter is melted and bubbling, pour in the eggs. Tilt the pan to ensure 
                the eggs evenly coat the surface.

                <br>
                <br>
              
                <span>4.</span> <strong>Add fillings (optional):</strong> When the eggs begin to set at the edges but are still slightly runny in the 
                middle, sprinkle your chosen fillings over one half of the omelette. 

                <br>
                <br>
              
                <span>5.</span> <strong>Fold and serve:</strong> As the omelette continues to cook, carefully lift one edge and fold it over the 
                fillings. Let it cook for another minute, then slide it onto a plate.

                <br>
                <br>
              
                <span>6.</span> <strong>Enjoy:</strong> Serve hot, with additional salt and pepper if needed.
